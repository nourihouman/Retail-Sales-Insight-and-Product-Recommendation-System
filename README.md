## Introduction

This project utilizes a dataset of store sales to:
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
- Create a user-item matrix for building a recommendation system.
- Develop a recommendation algorithm to suggest products to users.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for analysis. Key preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values.
- Normalizing numerical features.
- Encoding categorical variables.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is performed to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. This includes:
- Visualizing sales trends over time.
- Analyzing product popularity.
- Investigating user purchasing patterns.

## Recommendation System

A recommendation system is built using collaborative filtering techniques. The process involves:
- Creating a user-item interaction matrix.
- Calculating similarity scores between users.
- Recommending items to users based on their similarity to other users.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/store-sales-analysis.git
    cd store-sales-analysis
    ```

2. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
    Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can use the `requirements.txt` file if provided:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Open the `store sale.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells to perform the analysis and see the recommendations.

## Results

The recommendation system suggests products to users based on their purchase history and similarities with other users. Example recommendations include:
- USB-C Charging Cable
- Apple Airpods Headphones
- Bose SoundSport Headphones
- Wired Headphones
